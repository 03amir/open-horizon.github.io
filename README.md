# Open Horizon Quick Start

### Overview

Open Horizon is a middleware solution designed to manage the deployment and service software lifecycle of containerized applications. It also supports an optional separation of concerns between a service and related machine learning assets by providing a separate model sync service.  These solutions enable autonomous management of large fleets of edge compute nodes in various connected states.
