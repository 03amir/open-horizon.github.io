# Contribute

## Process

Contributions will only be considered when linked to an open issue, aligned with the project goals, and attested to by the Contributor (ex. signing off on a commit, accepting the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)).

To get assigned to an issue, start with on open issue labelled `Good First Issue` in one of the repositories and submit a comment on the issue requesting that it be assigned to you.  To get a quick response, try "at" mentioning a Maintainer or Working Group lead in your comment.

## How to Attest

All commits should be signed off (-s flag on git commit).

The -s option used for both alternatives causes a committer signed-off-by line to be appended to the end of the commit message body.  It certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to our [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). E.g.
`signed-off-by: John Doe johndoe@example.com`

 In order to use the -s option, you need to make sure you configure your git name (user.name) and email address (user.email):
```
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"

# To check
$ git config --list
```
